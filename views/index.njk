    <p>
      We're gathering feedback on people's experience of the dashboard. You can provide feedback 
      <span><a href="https://forms.office.com/e/xmvWHNhuBb">here.</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>The dashboard provides a snapshot of the health of our services, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vulnerabilities detected by <strong>Dependency track</strong></li>
      <li>Issues detected by <strong>SonarQube</strong></li>
      <li>Github details (release dates, ownership, etc)</li>
      <li>Which versions are deployed in each environment</li>
      <li>Language/Runtime details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information should be used by teams to plan, prioritise and monitor maintenance work for the services which they own.</p>
    <h3>The dashboards</h3>
    <p>There are 3 tabs, each displaying different information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Services</strong> - A list of services, grouped by team</li>
      <li><strong>Classic</strong> - Every available service version (the classic view)</li>
      <li><strong>Runtimes</strong> - A reference table with each runtime/language, including end of life dates</li>
    </ul>
