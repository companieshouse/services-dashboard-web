# services-dashboard-web

This service is the web component of the services dashboard.
_(Please refer to the main documentation in [services-dashboard-api](https://github.com/companieshouse/services-dashboard-api/) for an overview)._

It is primarily designed to display information stored in Mongo that has been collected by other components of the dashboard.
The same information can be displayed in different tabs. In other words, the dashboard provides multiple views of the data,
depending on the user (currently developers or product owners, though it can be extended for other roles, (such as testers) or use cases).
